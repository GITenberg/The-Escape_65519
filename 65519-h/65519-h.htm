<h2 class="nobreak">AUTHOR’S PREFACE.</h2>

</div>

<p>This play was written for my own amusement, and
not with the remotest thought that it would ever be
seen by the public eye. I read it privately, however,
to a circle of my friends, and through them was invited
to read it before a Literary Society. Since then, the
Drama has been given in various parts of the country.
By the earnest solicitation of some in whose judgment
I have the greatest confidence, I now present it in a
printed form to the public. As I never aspired to be
a dramatist, I ask no favor for it, and have little or no
solicitude for its fate. If it is not readable, no word
of mine can make it so; if it is, to ask favor for it
would be needless.</p>

<p>The main features in the Drama are true. <span class="smcap">Glen</span>
and <span class="smcap">Melinda</span> are actual characters, and still reside in
Canada. Many of the incidents were drawn from my
own experience of eighteen years at the South. The
marriage ceremony, as performed in the second act, is
still adhered to in many of the Southern States, especially
in the farming districts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>The ignorance of the slave, as seen in the case of
“<span class="smcap">Big Sally</span>,” is common wherever chattel slavery
exists. The difficulties created in the domestic circle
by the presence of beautiful slave women, as found in
<span class="smcap">Dr. Gaines’s</span> family, is well understood by all who
have ever visited the valley of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>The play, no doubt, abounds in defects, but as I was
born in slavery, and never had a day’s schooling in my
life, I owe the public no apology for errors.</p>

<h3><i>Scene 1.</i>—<span class="smcap">A Sitting-Room.</span></h3>

<div class="scene">

<p class="enter"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Dr. Gaines</span>, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i></p>

<p><i>Dr. Gaines.</i> Well, my dear, my practice is steadily increasing.
I forgot to tell you that neighbor Wyman engaged
me yesterday as his family physician; and I hope
that the fever and ague, which is now taking hold of the
people, will give me more patients. I see by the New
Orleans papers that the yellow fever is raging there to a
fearful extent. Men of my profession are reaping a harvest
in that section this year. I would that we could have
a touch of the yellow fever here, for I think I could invent
a medicine that would cure it. But the yellow fever is a
luxury that we medical men in this climate can’t expect to
enjoy; yet we may hope for the cholera.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gaines.</i> Yes, I would be glad to see it more sickly
here, so that your business might prosper. But we are always
unfortunate. Every body here seems to be in good
health, and I am afraid that they’ll keep so. However, we
must hope for the best. We must trust in the Lord.
Providence may possibly send some disease amongst us for
our benefit.</p>

<p class="enter"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Cato</span>, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i></p>

<p><i>Cato.</i> Mr. Campbell is at de door, massa.</p>

<p><i>Dr. G.</i> Ask him in, Cato.</p>

<p class="enter"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Mr. Campbell</span>, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i></p>

<p><i>Dr. G.</i> Good morning, Mr. Campbell. Be seated.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Campbell.</i> Good morning, doctor. The same to you,
Mrs. Gaines. Fine morning, this.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> Yes, sir; beautiful day.</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> Well, doctor, I’ve come to engage you for my
family physician. I am tired of Dr. Jones. I’ve lost
another very valuable nigger under his treatment; and, as
my old mother used to say, “change of pastures makes fat
calves.”</p>

<p><i>Dr. G.</i> I shall be most happy to become your doctor. Of
course, you want me to attend to your niggers, as well as to
your family?</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> Certainly, sir. I have twenty-three servants.
What will you charge me by the year?</p>

<p><i>Dr. G.</i> Of course, you’ll do as my other patients do,
send your servants to me when they are sick, if able to
walk?</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> Oh, yes; I always do that.</p>

<p><i>Dr. G.</i> Then I suppose I’ll have to lump it, and say
$500 per annum.</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> Well, then, we’ll consider that matter settled;
and as two of the boys are sick, I’ll send them over. So
I’ll bid you good day, doctor. I would be glad if you
would come over some time, and bring Mrs. Gaines with
you.</p>

<p><i>Dr. G.</i> Yes, I will; and shall be glad if you will pay us
a visit, and bring with you Mrs. Campbell. Come over and
spend the day.</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i> I will. Good morning, doctor.</p>

<p class="exit">[<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Mr. Campbell</span>, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i></p>

<p><i>Dr. G.</i> There, my dear, what do you think of that?
Five hundred dollars more added to our income. That’s
patronage worth having! And I am glad to get all the
negroes I can to doctor, for Cato is becoming very useful
to me in the shop. He can bleed, pull teeth, and do almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
any thing that the blacks require. He can put up medicine
as well as any one. A valuable boy, Cato!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> But why did you ask Mr. Campbell to visit you,
and to bring his wife? I am sure I could never consent to
associate with her, for I understand that she was the daughter
of a tanner. You must remember, my dear, that I was
born with a silver spoon in my mouth. The blood of the
Wyleys runs in my veins. I am surprised that you should
ask him to visit you at all; you should have known better.</p>

<p><i>Dr. G.</i> Oh, I did not mean for him to visit me. I only
invited him for the sake of compliments, and I think he so
understood it; for I should be far from wishing you to
associate with Mrs. Campbell. I don’t forget, my dear, the
family you were raised in, nor do I overlook my own
family. My father, you know, fought by the side of Washington,
and I hope some day to have a handle to my own
name. I am certain Providence intended me for something
higher than a medical man. Ah! by-the-by, I had forgotten
that I have a couple of patients to visit this morning. I
must go at once.</p>

you go out, tell Hannah to clean the white-handled knives,

<p><i>Cato.</i> Yes, massa; I dun made de intment, an’ now I is
making the bread pills. De tater pills is up on the top

<p><i>Dr. G.</i> I am going out to see some patients. If any gentlemen
call, tell them I shall be in this afternoon. If any
servants come, you attend to them. I expect two of Mr.
Campbell’s boys over. You see to them. Feel their pulse,
look at their tongues, bleed them, and give them each a dose
of calomel. Tell them to drink no cold water, and to take
nothing but water gruel.</p>

<h3><i>Scene 3.</i>—<span class="smcap">A Room in the Quarters.</span></h3>

<p class="enter"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Glen</span>, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i></p>

<p><i>Glen.</i> How slowly the time passes away. I’ve been
waiting here two hours, and Melinda has not yet come.
What keeps her, I cannot tell. I waited long and late for
her last night, and when she approached, I sprang to my
feet, caught her in my arms, pressed her to my heart, and
kissed away the tears from her moistened cheeks. She placed
her trembling hand in mine, and said, “Glen, I am yours;
I will never be the wife of another.” I clasped her to my
bosom, and called God to witness that I would ever regard
her as my wife. Old Uncle Joseph joined us in holy wedlock
by moonlight; that was the only marriage ceremony.
I look upon the vow as ever binding on me, for I am sure
that a just God will sanction our union in heaven. Still, this
man, who claims Melinda as his property, is unwilling for
me to marry the woman of my choice, because he wants
her himself. But he shall not have her. What he will say
when he finds that we are married, I cannot tell; but I am
determined to protect my wife or die. Ah! here comes
Melinda.</p>

<p class="enter"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Melinda</span>, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i></p>

<p class="noindent">I am glad to see you, Melinda. I’ve been waiting long,
and feared you would not come. Ah! in tears again?</p>

<p><i>Melinda.</i> Glen, you are always thinking I am in tears.
But what did master say to-day?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p><i>Glen.</i> He again forbade our union.</p>

<p><i>Melinda.</i> Indeed! Can he be so cruel?</p>

<p><i>Glen.</i> Yes, he can be just so cruel.</p>

<p><i>Melinda.</i> Alas! alas! how unfeeling and heartless!
But did you appeal to his generosity?</p>

<p><i>Glen.</i> Yes, I did; I used all the persuasive powers that I
was master of, but to no purpose; he was inflexible. He
even offered me a new suit of clothes, if I would give you
up; and when I told him that I could not, he said he would
flog me to death if I ever spoke to you again.</p>

<p><i>Melinda.</i> And what did you say to him?</p>

<p><i>Glen.</i> I answered, that, while I loved life better than
death, even life itself could not tempt me to consent to a
separation that would make life an unchanging curse. Oh,
I would kill myself, Melinda, if I thought that, for the sake
of life, I could consent to your degradation. No, Melinda,
I can die, but shall never live to see you the mistress of
another man. But, my dear girl, I have a secret to tell
you, and no one must know it but you. I will go out and
see that no person is within hearing. I will be back soon.</p>

<p class="exit">[<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Glen</span>, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i></p>

<p><i>Melinda.</i> It is often said that the darkest hour of the night
precedes the dawn. It is ever thus with the vicissitudes of
human suffering. After the soul has reached the lowest
depths of despair, and can no deeper plunge amid its rolling,
fœtid shades, then the reactionary forces of man’s nature
begin to operate, resolution takes the place of despondency,
energy succeeds instead of apathy, and an upward tendency
is felt and exhibited. Men then hope against power, and
smile in defiance of despair. I shall never forget when first
I saw Glen. It is now more than a year since he came
here with his master, Mr. Hamilton. It was a glorious
moonlight night in autumn. The wide and fruitful face of
nature was silent and buried in repose. The tall trees on
the borders of Muddy Creek waved their leafy branches in
the breeze, which was wafted from afar, refreshing over hill
and vale, over the rippling water, and the waving corn and
wheat fields. The starry sky was studded over with a few
light, flitting clouds, while the moon, as if rejoicing to witness
the meeting of two hearts that should be cemented by
the purest love, sailed triumphantly along among the shifting
vapors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>Oh, how happy I have been in my acquaintance with
Glen! That he loves me, I do well believe it; that I love
him, it is most true. Oh, how I would that those who think
the slave incapable of the finer feelings, could only see our
hearts, and learn our thoughts,—thoughts that we dare not
utter in the presence of our masters! But I fear that Glen
will be separated from me, for there is nothing too base and
mean for master to do, for the purpose of getting me
entirely in his power. But, thanks to Heaven, he does not
own Glen, and therefore cannot sell him. Yet he might
purchase him from his brother-in-law, so as to send him out
of the way. But here comes my husband.</p>

<p class="enter"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Glen</span>, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i></p>

<p><i>Glen.</i> I’ve been as far as the overseer’s house, and all is
quiet. Now, Melinda, as you are my wife, I will confide to
you a secret. I’ve long been thinking of making my escape
to Canada, and taking you with me. It is true that I don’t
belong to your master, but he might buy me from Hamilton,
and then sell me out of the neighborhood.</p>

<p><i>Melinda.</i> But we could never succeed in the attempt to
escape.</p>

<p><i>Glen.</i> We will make the trial, and show that we at least
deserve success. There is a slave trader expected here next
week, and Dr. Gaines would sell you at once if he knew
that we were married. We must get ready and start, and if
we can pass the Ohio river, we’ll be safe on the road to
Canada.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Mrs. Gaines.</i> Now, do give me more of your experience,
brother Pinchen. It always does my soul good to hear religious
experience. It draws me nearer and nearer to the
Lord’s side. I do love to hear good news from God’s people.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Pinchen.</i> Well, sister Gaines, I’ve had great opportunities
in my time to study the heart of man. I’ve attended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
a great many camp-meetings, revival meetings, protracted
meetings, and death-bed scenes, and I am satisfied, sister
Gaines, that the heart of man is full of sin, and desperately
wicked. This is a wicked world, sister Gaines, a wicked
world.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> Were you ever in Arkansas, brother Pinchen?
I’ve been told that the people out there are very ungodly.</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> Oh, yes, sister Gaines. I once spent a year at
Little Rock, and preached in all the towns round about
there; and I found some hard cases out there, I can tell you.
I was once spending a week in a district where there were
a great many horse thieves, and one night, somebody stole
my pony. Well, I knowed it was no use to make a fuss, so
I told brother Tarbox to say nothing about it, and I’d get
my horse by preaching God’s everlasting gospel; for I had
faith in the truth, and knowed that my Savior would not let
me lose my pony. So the next Sunday I preached on
horse-stealing, and told the brethren to come up in the evenin’
with their hearts filled with the grace of God. So
that night the house was crammed brim full with anxious
souls, panting for the bread of life. Brother Bingham opened
with prayer, and brother Tarbox followed, and I saw right
off that we were gwine to have a blessed time. After I
got ’em pretty well warmed up, I jumped on to one of the
seats, stretched out my hands, and said, “I know who stole
my pony; I’ve found out; and you are in here tryin’ to
make people believe that you’ve got religion; but you ain’t
got it. And if you don’t take my horse back to brother
Tarbox’s pasture this very night, I’ll tell your name right
out in meetin’ to-morrow night. Take my pony back, you
vile and wretched sinner, and come up here and give your
heart to God.” So the next mornin’, I went out to brother
Tarbox’s pasture, and sure enough, there was my bob-tail
pony. Yes, sister Gaines, there he was, safe and sound.
Ha, ha, ha.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> Oh, how interesting, and how fortunate for you
to get your pony! And what power there is in the gospel!
God’s children are very lucky. Oh, it is so sweet to sit
here and listen to such good news from God’s people! You
Hannah, what are you standing there listening for, and neglecting
your work? Never mind, my lady, I’ll whip you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
well when I am done here. Go at your work this moment,
you lazy huzzy! Never mind, I’ll whip you well. [<i>Aside.</i>]
Come, do go on, brother Pinchen, with your godly conversation.
It is so sweet! It draws me nearer and nearer to
the Lord’s side.</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> Well, sister Gaines, I’ve had some mighty queer
dreams in my time, that I have. You see, one night I
dreamed that I was dead and in heaven, and such a place I
never saw before. As soon as I entered the gates of the
celestial empire, I saw many old and familiar faces that I
had seen before. The first person that I saw was good old
Elder Pike, the preacher that first called my attention to
religion. The next person I saw was Deacon Billings, my
first wife’s father, and then I saw a host of godly faces.
Why, sister Gaines, you knowed Elder Goosbee, didn’t
you?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> Why, yes; did you see him there? He married
me to my first husband.</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> Oh, yes, sister Gaines, I saw the old Elder, and
he looked for all the world as if he had just come out of a
revival meetin’.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> Did you see my first husband there, brother
Pinchen?</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> No, sister Gaines, I didn’t see brother Pepper
there; but I’ve no doubt but that brother Pepper was there.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> Well, I don’t know; I have my doubts. He
was not the happiest man in the world. He was always
borrowing trouble about something or another. Still, I saw
some happy moments with Mr. Pepper. I was happy when
I made his acquaintance, happy during our courtship, happy
a while after our marriage, and happy when he died.
[<i>Weeps.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> Massa Pinchen, did you see my ole man Ben up
dar in hebben?</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> No, Hannah; I didn’t go amongst the niggers.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> No, of course brother Pinchen didn’t go among
the blacks. What are you asking questions for? Never
mind, my lady, I’ll whip you well when I’m done here.
I’ll skin you from head to foot. [<i>Aside.</i>] Do go on with
your heavenly conversation, brother Pinchen; it does my
very soul good. This is indeed a precious moment for me.
I do love to hear of Christ and Him crucified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> Well, sister Gaines, I promised sister Daniels
that I’d come over and see her this morning, and have a
little season of prayer with her, and I suppose I must go.
I’ll tell you more of my religious experience when I return.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> If you must go, then I’ll have to let you; but
before you do, I wish to get your advice upon a little matter
that concerns Hannah. Last week, Hannah stole a goose,
killed it, cooked it, and she and her man Sam had a fine
time eating the goose; and her master and I would never
have known a word about it, if it had not been for Cato, a
faithful servant, who told his master. And then, you see,
Hannah had to be severely whipped before she’d confess
that she stole the goose. Next Sabbath is sacrament day,
and I want to know if you think that Hannah is fit to go to
the Lord’s supper after stealing the goose.</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> Well, sister Gaines, that depends on circumstances.
If Hannah has confessed that she stole the goose,
and has been sufficiently whipped, and has begged her master’s
pardon, and begged your pardon, and thinks she’ll
never do the like again, why then I suppose she can go to
the Lord’s supper; for</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“While the lamp holds out to burn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The vilest sinner may return.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But she must be sure that she has repented, and won’t steal
any more.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> Now, Hannah, do you hear that? For my own
part, I don’t think she’s fit to go to the Lord’s supper, for
she had no occasion to steal the goose. We give our niggers
plenty of good wholesome food. They have a full run
to the meal tub, meat once a fortnight, and all the sour milk
about the place, and I’m sure that’s enough for any one.
I do think that our niggers are the most ungrateful creatures
in the world, that I do. They aggravate my life out of me.</p>

<p><i>Hannah.</i> I know, missis, dat I steal de goose, and massa
whip me for it, and I confess it, and I is sorry for it. But,
missis, I is gwine to de Lord’s supper, next Sunday, kase I
ain’t a-gwine to turn my back on my bressed Lord an’ Massa
for no old tough goose, dat I ain’t. [<i>Weeps.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> Well, sister Gaines, I suppose I must go over
and see sister Daniels; she’ll be waiting for me.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> Now, Hannah, brother Pinchen is gone, do you
get the cowhide and follow me to the cellar, and I’ll whip
you well for aggravating me as you have to-day. It seems
as if I can never sit down to take a little comfort with the
Lord, without you crossing me. The devil always puts it
into your head to disturb me, just when I am trying to
serve the Lord. I’ve no doubt but that I’ll miss going to
heaven on your account. But I’ll whip you well before I
leave this world, that I will. Get the cowhide and follow
me to the cellar.</p>

<p><i>Walk.</i> Well, you see, doctor, I comes when I em not

take advantage of the times. Now, doctor, ef you’ve got
any niggers that you wants to sell, I em your man. I am
paying the highest price of any body in the market. I
pay cash down, and no grumblin’.</p>

<p><i>Dr. G.</i> I don’t know that I want to sell any of my people
now. Still, I’ve got to make up a little money next
month, to pay in bank; and another thing, the doctors say
that we are likely to have a touch of the cholera this summer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
and if that’s the case, I suppose I had better turn as
many of my slaves into cash as I can.</p>

<p><i>Walk.</i> Yes, doctor, that is very true. The cholera is
death on slaves, and a thousand dollars in your pocket is a
great deal better than a nigger in the field, with cholera at
his heels. Why, who is that coming up the lane? It’s Mr.
Wildmarsh, as I live! Jest the very man I wants to see.</p>

<p class="enter"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Mr. Wildmarsh</span>.</i></p>

you, doctor? I am glad to see you both looking so well.
You seem in remarkably good health, doctor?</p>

health. I hope you left all well at Licking?</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Yes, I thank you. And now, Mr. Walker, how
goes times with you?</p>

<p><i>Walk.</i> Well, you see, Squire, I em in good spirits. The
price of niggers is up in the market, and I am lookin’ out
for bargains; and I was jest intendin’ to come over to Lickin’
to see you, to see if you had any niggers to sell. But it
seems as ef the Lord knowed that I wanted to see you, and
directed your steps over here. Now, Squire, ef you’ve
got any niggers you wants to sell, I em your man. I am
payin’ the highest cash price of any body in the market.
Now’s your time, Squire.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> No, I don’t think I want to sell any of my slaves
now. I sold a very valuable gal to Mr. Haskins last week.
I tell you, she was a smart one. I got eighteen hundred
dollars for her.</p>

<p><i>Walk.</i> Why, Squire, how you do talk! Eighteen hundred
dollars for one gal? She must have been a screamer
to bring that price. What sort of a lookin’ critter was she?
I should like to have bought her.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> She was a little of the smartest gal I’ve ever raised;
that she was.</p>

<p><i>Walk.</i> Then she was your own raising, was she?</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Oh, yes; she was raised on my place, and if I
could have kept her three or four years longer, and taken
her to the market myself, I am sure I could have sold her
for three thousand dollars. But you see, Mr. Walker, my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
wife got a little jealous, and you know jealousy sets the
women’s heads a teetering, and so I had to sell the gal.
She’s got straight hair, blue eyes, prominent features, and
is almost white. Haskins will make a spec, and no mistake.</p>

<p><i>Walk.</i> Why, Squire, was she that pretty little gal that I
saw on your knee the day that your wife was gone, when I
was at your place three years ago?</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> Yes, the same.</p>

<p><i>Walk.</i> Well, now, Squire, I thought that was your daughter;
she looked mightily like you. She was your daughter,
wasn’t she? You need not be ashamed to own it to me, for
I am mum upon such matters.</p>

<p><i>Wild.</i> You know, Mr. Walker, that people will talk, and
when they talk, they say a great deal; and people did talk,
and many said the gal was my daughter; and you know we
can’t help people’s talking. But here comes the Rev. Mr.
Pinchen; I didn’t know that he was in the neighborhood.</p>

<p class="noindent">Why, how do you do, Mr. Pinchen? What in the name
of Jehu brings you down here to Muddy Creek? Any
camp-meetins, revival meetins, death-bed scenes, or any
thing else in your line going on down here? How is religion
prosperin’ now, Mr. Pinchen? I always like to hear
about religion.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Pin.</i> Well, Mr. Walker, the Lord’s work is in good
condition every where now. I tell you, Mr. Walker, I’ve
been in the gospel ministry these thirteen years, and I am
satisfied that the heart of man is full of sin and desperately
wicked. This is a wicked world, Mr. Walker, a wicked
world, and we ought all of us to have religion. Religion is
a good thing to live by, and we all want it when we die.
Yes, sir, when the great trumpet blows, we ought to be
ready. And a man in your business of buying and selling
slaves needs religion more than any body else, for it makes
you treat your people as you should. Now, there is Mr.
Haskins,—he is a slave-trader, like yourself. Well, I converted
him. Before he got religion, he was one of the worst
men to his niggers I ever saw; his heart was as hard as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
stone. But religion has made his heart as soft as a piece of
cotton. Before I converted him, he would sell husbands
from their wives, and seem to take delight in it; but now he
won’t sell a man from his wife, if he can get anyone to buy
both of them together. I tell you, sir, religion has done a
wonderful work for him.</p>

<p><i>Walk.</i> I know, Mr. Pinchen, that I ought to have religion,
and I feel that I am a great sinner; and whenever I get
with good pious people like you and the doctor, and Mr.
Wildmarsh, it always makes me feel that I am a desperate
sinner. I feel it the more, because I’ve got a religious turn
of mind. I know that I would be happier with religion, and
the first spare time I get, I am going to try to get it. I’ll go
to a protracted meeting, and I won’t stop till I get religion.
Yes, I’ll scuffle with the Lord till I gets forgiven. But it
always makes me feel bad to talk about religion, so I’ll
change the subject. Now, doctor, what about them thar
niggers you thought you could sell me?</p>

<p><i>Dr. Gaines.</i> I’ll see my wife, Mr. Walker, and if she is
willing to part with Hannah, I’ll sell you Sam and his wife,
Hannah. Ah! here comes my wife; I’ll mention it.</p>

<p class="enter"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Mrs. Gaines</span>, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i></p>

<p class="noindent">Ah! my dear, I am glad you’ve come. I was just telling
Mr. Walker, that if you were willing to part with Hannah,
I’d sell him Sam and Hannah.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> Now, Dr. Gaines, I am astonished and surprised
that you should think of such a thing. You know what
trouble I’ve had in training up Hannah for a house servant,
and now that I’ve got her so that she knows my ways, you
want to sell her. Haven’t you niggers enough on the plantation
to sell, without selling the servants from under my
very nose?</p>

<p><i>Dr. G.</i> Oh, yes, my dear; but I can spare Sam, and I
don’t like to separate him from his wife; and I thought if
you could let Hannah go, I’d sell them both. I don’t like
to separate husbands from their wives.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> Now, gentlemen, that’s just the way with my
husband. He thinks more about the welfare and comfort of
his slaves, than he does of himself or his family. I am
sure you need not feel so bad at the thought of separating
Sam from Hannah. They’ve only been married eight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
months, and their attachment can’t be very strong in that
short time. Indeed, I shall be glad if you do sell Sam, for
then I’ll make Hannah <i>jump the broomstick</i> with Cato, and
I’ll have them both here under my eye. I never will again
let one of my house servants marry a field hand—never!
For when night comes on, the servants are off to the quarters,
and I have to holler and holler enough to split my
throat before I can make them hear. And another thing: I
want you to sell Melinda. I don’t intend to keep that mulatto
wench about the house any longer.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Gaines.</i> My dear, I’ll sell any servant from the place
to suit you, except Melinda. I can’t think of selling her—I
can’t think of it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> I tell you that Melinda shall leave this house, or
I’ll go. There, now you have it. I’ve had my life tormented
out of me by the presence of that yellow wench, and
I’ll stand it no longer. I know you love her more than you
do me, and I’ll—I’ll—I’ll write—write to my father.

<p><i>Walk.</i> Why, doctor, your wife’s a screamer, ain’t she?
Ha, ha, ha. Why, doctor, she’s got a tongue of her own,
ain’t she? Why, doctor, it was only last week that I thought
of getting a wife myself; but your wife has skeered the idea
out of my head. Now, doctor, if you wants to sell the gal,
I’ll buy her. Husband and wife ought to be on good terms,
and your wife won’t feel well till the gal is gone. Now,
I’ll pay you all she’s worth, if you wants to sell.</p>

<p><i>Dr. G.</i> No, Mr. Walker; the girl my wife spoke of is
not for sale. My wife does not mean what she says; she’s
only a little jealous. I’ll get brother Pinchen to talk to
her, and get her mind turned upon religious matters, and
then she’ll forget it. She’s only a little jealous.</p>

<p><i>Walk.</i> I tell you what, doctor, ef you call that a little
jealous, I’d like to know what’s a heap. I tell you, it will
take something more than religion to set your wife right.
You had better sell me the gal; I’ll pay you cash down, and
no grumblin’.</p>

<p><i>Dr. G.</i> The girl is not for sale, Mr. Walker; but if you
want two good, able-bodied servants, I’ll sell you Sam and
Big Sally. Sam is trustworthy, and Sally is worth her
weight in gold for rough usage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p><i>Walk.</i> Well, doctor, I’ll go out and take a look at ’em,
for I never buys slaves without examining them well, because
they are sometimes injured by over-work or under-feedin’.
I don’t say that is the case with yours, for I don’t
believe it is; but as I sell on honor, I must buy on honor.</p>

<p><i>Dr. G.</i> Walk out, sir, and you can examine them to your
heart’s content. Walk right out, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> I is Big Sally, sir.</p>

<p><i>Walk.</i> Ha, ha, ha. Well, doctor, this is the greenest lot
of niggers I’ve seen for some time. Well, what do you
ask for them?</p>

<p><i>Dr. Gaines.</i> You may have Sam for $1000, and Sally
for $900. They are worth all I ask for them. You know
I never banter, Mr. Walker. There they are; you can
take them at that price, or let them alone, just as you please.</p>

<p><i>Walk.</i> Well, doctor, I reckon I’ll take ’em; but it’s all
they are worth. I’ll put the handcuffs on ’em, and then I’ll
pay you. I likes to go accordin’ to Scripter. Scripter says
ef eatin’ meat will offend your brother, you must quit it;
and I say, ef leavin’ your slaves without the handcuffs will
make ’em run away, you must put the handcuffs on ’em.
Now, Sam, don’t you and Sally cry. I am of a tender
heart, and it allers makes me feel bad to see people cryin’.
Don’t cry, and the first place I get to, I’ll buy each of you
a great big <i>ginger cake</i>,—that I will. Now, Mr. Pinchen, I
wish you were going down the river. I’d like to have your
company; for I allers likes the company of preachers.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Pinchen.</i> Well, Mr. Walker, I would be much pleased
to go down the river with you, but it’s too early for me. I
expect to go to Natchez in four or five weeks, to attend a
camp-meetin’, and if you were going down then, I’d like
it. What kind of niggers sells best in the Orleans market,
Mr. Walker?</p>

<p><i>Walk.</i> Why, field hands. Did you think of goin’ in the
trade?</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> Oh, no; only it’s a long ways down to Natchez,
and I thought I’d just buy five or six niggers, and take ’em
down and sell ’em to pay my travellin’ expenses. I only
want to clear my way.</p>

Thee for this manifestation of Thy kindness. Come, come,

struck him over the head with his own club, and I made
the wine flow freely; yes, I pounded his old skillet well
for him, and then jumped out of the window. It was a
leap for freedom. Yes, Melinda, it was a leap for freedom.
I’ve said “master” for the last time. I am free;
I’m bound for Canada. Come, let’s be off, at once, for
the negro dogs will be put upon our track. Let us once
get beyond the Ohio river, and all will be right.</p>

<p><i>Jennings.</i> Say Mr. Jennings, if you please.</p>

<p><i>Barkeeper.</i> Well, Mr. Jennings, if that suits you better.
How are times? We’ve been expecting you, for some
days.</p>

<p><i>Jennings.</i> Well, before I talk about the times, I want my
horses put up, and want you to tell me where my niggers
are to stay to-night. Sheds, stables, barns, and every thing
else here, seems pretty full, if I am a judge.</p>

<p><i>Barkeeper.</i> Oh! I’ll see to your plunder.</p>

<p><i>1st Lounger.</i> I say, Barkeeper, make me a brandy cocktail,
strong. Why, how do you do, Mr. Jennings?</p>

<p><i>Jennings.</i> Pretty well, Mr. Peters. Cold evening, this.</p>

<p><i>1st Loun.</i> Yes, this is cold. I heard you speak of your
niggers. Have you got a pretty large gang?</p>

<p><i>Jennings.</i> No, only thirty-three. But they are the best
that the country can afford. I shall clear a few dimes, this
trip. I hear that the price is up.</p>

<p class="enter"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Mr. White</span>, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i></p>

<p><i>White.</i> Can I be accommodated here to-night, landlord?</p>

<p><i>Barkeeper.</i> Yes, sir; we’ve bed for man and beast. Go,
Dick, and take the gentleman’s coat and hat. [<i>To the
waiter.</i>] You’re a stranger in these parts, I rec’on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p><i>White.</i> Yes, I am a stranger here.</p>

<p><i>2d Loun.</i> Where mout you come from, ef it’s a far
question?</p>

<p><i>White.</i> I am from Massachusetts.</p>

<p><i>3d Loun.</i> I say, cuss Massachusetts!</p>

<p><i>1st Loun.</i> I say so too. There is where the fanatics
live; cussed traitors. The President ought to hang ’em all.</p>

<p><i>White.</i> I say, landlord, if this is the language that I am
to hear, I would like to go into a private room.</p>

<p><i>Barkeeper.</i> We ain’t got no private room empty.</p>

<p><i>1st Loun.</i> Maybe you’re mad ’bout what I said ’bout
your State. Ef you is, I’ve only to say that this is a free
country, and people talks what they please; an’ ef you
don’t like it, you can better yourself.</p>

<p><i>White.</i> Sir, if this is a free country, why do you have
slaves here? I saw a gang at the door, as I came in.</p>

<p><i>2d Loun.</i> He didn’t mean that this was a free country
for niggers. He meant that it’s free for white people.
And another thing, ef you get to talking ’bout freedom for
niggers, you’ll catch what you won’t like, mister. It’s
right for niggers to be slaves.</p>

<p><i>White.</i> But I saw some white slaves.</p>

<p><i>1st Loun.</i> Well, they’re white niggers.</p>

<p><i>White.</i> Well, sir, I am from a free State, and I thank
God for it; for the worst act that a man can commit upon
his fellow-man, is to make him a slave. Conceive of a
mind, a living soul, with the germs of faculties which infinity
cannot exhaust, as it first beams upon you in its glad
morning of existence, quivering with life and joy, exulting
in the glorious sense of its developing energies, beautiful,
and brave, and generous, and joyous, and free,—the clear
pure spirit bathed in the auroral light of its unconscious immortality,—and
then follow it in its dark and dreary passage
through slavery, until oppression stifles and kills, one by
one, every inspiration and aspiration of its being, until it
becomes a dead soul entombed in a living frame!</p>

<p><i>3d Loun.</i> Stop that; stop that, I say. That’s treason
to the country; that’s downright rebellion.</p>

<p><i>Barkeeper.</i> Yes, it is. And another thing,—this is not a
meeting-house.</p>

<p><i>1st Loun.</i> Yes, if you talk such stuff as that, you’ll get a
chunk of cold lead in you, that you will.</p>

hurry thyself, when I send thee for the horses, Thomas.

<p><i>Thomas.</i> Well, you see I’ve been writing poetry; that’s
the reason I’ve been so long. If you wish it, I’ll sing it to

<p><i>Mrs. Neal.</i> Yes, if Thomas has written a ditty, do let us
hear it.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Neal.</i> Well, Thomas, if thee has a ditty, thee may
recite it to us.</p>

<p><i>Thomas.</i> Well, I’ll give it to you. Remember that I
call it, “The Underground Railroad.”</p>

</div>

<p>☞ The following are but few of the favorable notices
given of “<span class="smcap">The Escape</span>,” where it has been publicly read:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A novel Dramatic Reading took place last evening at Sansom
Street Hall, by <span class="smcap">Wm. Wells Brown</span>, the colored dramatic writer,
which was highly entertaining, and gave the greatest satisfaction
to an intelligent and appreciative audience. The Drama is instructive,
as well as very laughable.—<i>Philadelphia Evening Bulletin.</i></p>

<p>All who heard <span class="smcap">Mr. Brown’s</span> Drama were highly gratified. It
is well executed, and was finely delivered.—<i>Philadelphia Morning
Times.</i></p>

<p>The Dramatic Reading of <span class="smcap">Mr. Wm. Wells Brown</span>, last evening,
was well attended, and gave the most unbounded satisfaction.
<span class="smcap">Mr. Brown’s</span> Drama is, in itself, a masterly refutation of
all apologies for slavery, and abounds in wit, satire, philosophy,
argument and facts, all ingeniously interwoven into one of the
most interesting dramatic compositions of modern times.—<i>Auburn
(N. Y.) Daily Advertiser.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Brown</span> exhibits a dramatic talent possessed by few who
have, under the best instructions, made themselves famous on the
stage. He evinces a talent for tragic and comic representation
rarely combined. If you want a good laugh, go and hear him.
If you want instruction or information upon the most interesting
question of the day, go and hear him. You cannot fail to be
pleased. So highly pleased were those who heard it in Auburn,
that twenty-eight of the leading men of the city, over their own
signatures, extended an invitation to him, through the <i>Daily Advertiser</i>,
to return and repeat the Drama. Among them we
recognize the names of Hon. B. F. Hall, of the State Senate, and
the Rev. Wm. Hosmer, editor of the <i>Northern Independent</i>.
Such a compliment entitles <span class="smcap">Mr. Brown</span> to crowded houses wherever
he goes.—<i>Seneca Falls Courier.</i></p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
